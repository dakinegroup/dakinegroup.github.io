# Requirements - Detailing, Wireframes, Data Structuring, release scoping
Detailed requirements are captured to guide team as well as shared with customer on need basis.

With detailed requirements, clear understanding of scope is achieved. Detailed requirements capture information from customer side i.e. look and feel of product (Wireframes), Data points that are provided by users of system as well as consumed by them (reports), any processing logic / workflows on data, staging of features over time in different software releases.

It is important to highlight here that DKT believes in building product incrementally and going through user test at every stage. By very nature of this way of working, it becomes important to automate testing and other elements of process. Also, it enables team to innovate and get closer to the end user requirement. These changes on the way are tracked and managed through change management system.

As these detailed requirements are understood and agreed with customer, other norms in terms of project management, quality, IPR ownership as terms are agreed.

This phase of initial requirements where a detailed solution, an understanding on project / processes is documented, reviewed and agreed, is a paid activity. Customer has an option to exit after this phase.
