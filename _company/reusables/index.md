#Reusables

<blockquote>Good programmers know what to write. Great ones know what to rewrite (and reuse) 
<div class="author">Eric S. Raymond in "The Cathedral and the Bazaar"</div></blockquote>

DKT (da Kine Technologies), believes in zero bench and hence maximizing on the costs incurred to create and innovate. Team is able to learn and apply new technologies, remind themselves of lean and mean principles at work.

Team at DKT is constantly working on creating components that are related to the organization business focus, which are company's IPR. This helps DKT invest their time prudently and also save some costs of development as well as lead time when it comes to project execution. All such creations as well maintained in document and source code control systems. It ensures that organization has a memory of it's learnings and creations which are retrievable whenever required reliably and also enhanced over time.

Reuse not only applies to source code at DKT. It has a positive impact on learnability of team, building long term relationships with customer. Reuse as a concept applies to organization knowledge at high level and we strive to take it forward everyday in every aspect of business.

It is well said somewhere..

<blockquote> Good programmers write good code; great programmers steal </blockquote>

Often remembering what was written and where is it, is a great hindrance for organization to be a productive programmers hub.
